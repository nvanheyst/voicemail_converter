# Explanation:
# Pydub: We use pydub to load the file and convert it to a more compatible format if it's in a non-PCM encoding (like format 49).
# Format Conversion: The audio is converted to 16kHz, mono, which is optimal for speech recognition.
# Required Libraries:
# Install pydub:
# pip install pydub
# If you havenâ€™t installed ffmpeg (or avconv), you can download it or use a similar tool to ensure pydub can decode the non-PCM audio:

# ffmpeg: Download and install ffmpeg (then add to path)
# Once pydub and ffmpeg (or another backend) are properly set up, this program should be able to handle non-PCM audio formats and transcribe them.
